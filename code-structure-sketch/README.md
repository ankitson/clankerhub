# Code-Level Structure Report

## Objective
Provide a code-level structure sketch for the AI-powered web app platform, assuming infrastructure (Terraform, Docker, Cloudflare, etc.) is already provisioned.

## Deliverables
- **Code sketch** with proposed repo layout, module responsibilities, and TypeScript snippets for:
  - client chat/generation pipeline
  - preview sandbox bridge
  - edge routing + LLM gateway
  - AI output validation
  - sync engine and Dexie persistence
  - service worker sync

## Files
- `code-sketch.md`: detailed layout and component sketches.
- `notes.md`: working notes from the task.

## Usage
Use `code-sketch.md` as a blueprint to scaffold the platform repository and to align teams on module boundaries, data flow, and integration points.
